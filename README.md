# Prolog-Project "Schedule making" (Worked on it alone)

The scheduling problem is a very popular problem in computer science, Say that you must find a schedule
of classes for the entire university to satisfy some reasonable constrains, such as that no two classes take
place in the same room at the same time. If you have just a thousand classes, finding the best schedule
may require centuries, even with a supercomputer.
This is where we come in and we try to take a shot at the scheduling problem. We will have a small
knowledge base not a thousand classes and a small number of constrains which will make this project
computable in a reasonable time.
